| Theseus                                                   | Hippolyta                                     |
+===========================================================+===============================================+
| - King of Athens, Greek hero                              | - Queen of the Amazons, warrior               |
| - Killed Minotaur                                         | - didn't depend on men -> independent         |
| - Son of Poseidon                                         | - Symbol for femal strengt                    |
| - went to war, conquered Amazons -> H.                    | - Daughter of Ares                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+


- Because of his conquering her tribe, she could be seen as a "*trophy*"
- She is a warrior and doesn't like being conquered
    - possible conflict between T. and H.

### Monologue

Hippolyta says very little during this emotional controcersy about a girl's
unhappy future. In a short monolog, imagin what she might say to Theseus about
the situation and his judgment.


::: example
monologue $\neq$ soliloquy

**Monologue:** Everybody can hear it

**Soliloquy:** Only the spectater can hear it, not the other characters.
:::

::: inmargin
**My lord** is probably not correct. Figures like *Helena* do call him "*My lord*" but not Hippolyta.
:::


My lord, I have watched the events of this day with a heart heavier than you
may know. This quarrel over a maiden’s future, her heart torn between love and
obedience, weighs upon my spirit. Theseus, you speak of law and duty, of the
edicts that must bind us all, yet I wonder — does the law not also possess a
heart?

Hermia stands before us, her love for Lysander clear, her resolve unwavering.
Is it just to force her into a life she does not choose, simply to uphold the
words of men? My lord, you have conquered my lands, but you have also won my
heart. Yet, it was not by force or decree, but through your honor and respect
that I came to love you. Can we not afford Hermia the same grace? To allow love
to flourish in its natural course, untainted by fear?


#### Notes

- Why cant hermia have the same grace in terms freely unfolding love

```{=context}

```

### Possible outcomes

- Hermia and Lysander decisions is quite good, 
- Outcome is hard to predict

Hermia and Lysander wont reach their destination, because Helena is gonne tell
Demitrius their plan to run away.

There will be a big conflict. They will be caught, before they are safe of the athenian law.
