**Task:**

Analyze the means Shakespeare uses to characterize the workmen, or
"Mechanicals". Illustrate your findings by giving examples of their vocabulary
and manner of speaking.
:::

**Notes:**

- No meter in this scene - Flute: "Here, Peter Quince" - No iambic pentameter
- Easier Language - Simpler Vocab (l. 63, "That would hang us, every mother's son")
- Short sentences, in comparison to Scene. 1, makes it easier to understand
- "good Peter Quince,"

::: inmargin
**Jovial:** spielerisch
:::

- "Is all our *company* here?" (Sentence 1.) - Multiple meanings - (*homolyte*,) *pun*, *play on words*
    - Sind alle companions da?
    - Sind alle Mitarbeitenden da?
    - Sind alle Soldaten da?

::: example
**Structure tip:**

- Einleitung: Vorstellung der Absicht des Autor und / oder these zur Aufgabenstellung
- Sonst Ã¤hnlich, wie bei summary, nur ohne Inhalt.
- Shakespear stellt die workmans einfach dar, dies wird durch die sprach etc verdeutlicht.

**Analysis:**

In the Act One, scene 2 of the play "A Midsummer night's Dream", by Shakespeare
and published in 1595, characterize the "Mechanicals" as simple man through
the manner of speaking.

##### The Meter

The first thing that points out is the use of the meter. Although Shakespeare
uses the iambic pentameter consistently in the first scene, it is completely
missing out in the second one. The iambic pentameter elevates the language and
wording, and so characterizes a more thoughtful use of language. The missing
out of a meter at all points out that the "Mechanicals" attach less importance
to sophisticated language.


##### company

Right in the beginning of Scene 2, Quince asks if "is all our company here?"
(l. ...). With this he refers to all the people working in the play, they are
about to perform. The word *company* can be interpreted in mainly three
different ways. He could mean a *Fellowship or Companionship*, hint at a
*professional* association, or a *theatrical company*.
