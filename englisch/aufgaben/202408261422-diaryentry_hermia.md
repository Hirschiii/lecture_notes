Dear Diary,

Tonight, I write to you with a heart heavy with fear but alight with hope. The
decisions I made weren't easy but I'm sure they are the right ones.
Tomorrow I will leave the only home I every knew. I will run away and in doing
so, I'm fighting for love and freedom. I'm choosing the hard path, to be with my
love, over a forced marriage I can't consent to. 

I wish my father could understand me and my heavy heart, but all he shows is
adamant. I wish he could see that love cannot be force, that it cannot be
shaped to his desires. My love for lysander as pure, as the great waterfalls of Athen. 

What harm is there in following ones heart? Why should the will of my father and the law of Athens stand in the way of happiness?

Today is my final day in prison, tomorrow I will be free. Tomorrow I can life in peace, without being suppressed. 

I cannot lie, dear diary - I am terrified. The idea of change is scary and
hopeful simultaneously. Leaving home, abandoning everything Iâ€™ve ever known, is
a daunting prospect. But when I think of a life without Lysander, I know I could not bear it.
