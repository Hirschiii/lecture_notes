**Task:**

Hippolyta says very little during this emotional controcersy about a girl's
unhappy future. In a short monolog, imagin what she might say to Theseus about
the situation and his judgment.

::: example
**Good to know:**

monologue $\neq$ soliloquy

**Monologue:** Everybody can hear it

**Soliloquy:** Only the spectater can hear it, not the other characters.

**My lord** is probably not correct. Figures like *Helena* do call him "*My lord*" but not Hippolyta. She would not use language that implies such a herachy.

::: dramaframedtext
My lord, I have watched the events of this day with a heart heavier than you
may know. This quarrel over a maiden’s future, her heart torn between love and
obedience, weighs upon my spirit. Theseus, you speak of law and duty, of the
edicts that must bind us all, yet I wonder — does the law not also possess a
heart?

Hermia stands before us, her love for Lysander clear, her resolve unwavering.
Is it just to force her into a life she does not choose, simply to uphold the
words of men? My lord, you have conquered my lands, but you have also won my
heart. Yet, it was not by force or decree, but through your honor and respect
that I came to love you. Can we not afford Hermia the same grace? To allow love
to flourish in its natural course, untainted by fear?
