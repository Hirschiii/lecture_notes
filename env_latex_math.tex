\startenvironment env_latex_math

% Commands to translate LaTeX environment calls
% into the appropriate ConTeXt macros.

% The \end of a \begin,\end pair is problematic, since \stoptext
% depends on TeX's \end.  We fix that as follows, using the 
% \everystoptext hook.  (Note that some versions of ConTeXt
% have already redefined \end, but this should all work out.

\unprotect
\let\@@end=\end
\appendtoks
  \let\end=\@@end
\to \everystoptext
\protect

% With that out of the way, the actual trans-
% lation macros are straightforward.
