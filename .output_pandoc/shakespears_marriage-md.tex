{\bf Arranged marriages}

Marrying for love is a relatively new concept. For many centuries,
matchmaking and arranging marriages for their children was the parents'
privilege. In many societies worldwide, arranged marriages are still
common. There are different types of arranged marriages: {\bf forced
marriages}, where bride and groom have no say in the matter due to
social conventions; {\bf child marriages} (also called early marriages),
where at least one of the two people is not of adult age; and {\bf
pragmatic marriages}, where the partners have agreed to the pairing a
matchmaker or parent has chosen.
