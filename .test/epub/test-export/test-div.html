     <div class="paragraph">Thus, I came to the conclusion that the designer of a new system must not only be the implementer and first large--scale user; the designer should also write the first user manual.      <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
The separation of any of these four components would have hurt TEX significantly. If I had not participated fully in all these activities, literally hundreds of improve­ments would never have been made, because I would never have thought of them or perceived why they were important.      <div class="break"><!--empty--></div>
But a system cannot be successful if it is too strongly influenced by a single person. Once the initial design is complete and fairly robust, the real test begins as people with many different viewpoints undertake their own experiments.</div>
     <div class="paragraph">Coming back to the use of typefaces in electronic publishing: many of the new ty­pographers receive their knowledge and information about the rules of typography from books, from computer magazines or the instruction manuals which they get with the purchase of a PC or software. There is not so much basic instruction, as of now, as there was in the old days, showing the differences between good and bad typographic design. Many people are just fascinated by their PC&apos;s tricks, and think that a widely--praised program, called up on the screen, will make every­thing automatic from now on.</div>
